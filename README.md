🧠 IPC Debugger (Simulation-Based)

📌 Overview

The IPC Debugger is a simulation-based Inter-Process Communication (IPC) debugging and monitoring tool developed in C for Windows systems. The project demonstrates and analyzes the working of major IPC mechanisms—Pipes, Message Queues, and Shared Memory—using multithreading, synchronization, and logging techniques.

Since native Windows systems do not support POSIX IPC system calls, this project implements a conceptual simulation that preserves the theoretical behavior of IPC mechanisms while remaining executable on Windows.

🎯 Objectives

To demonstrate Inter-Process Communication (IPC) concepts

To simulate Pipe, Message Queue, and Shared Memory IPC

To monitor IPC operations using thread state tracking

To log IPC events for debugging and analysis

To build an OS-lab-ready IPC Debugger project

⚙️ Features

🔹 Pipe IPC simulation

🔹 Message Queue IPC simulation

🔹 Shared Memory IPC simulation

🔹 Multithreaded execution using Windows threads

🔹 Thread lifecycle and state monitoring

🔹 Centralized logging (ipc_log.txt)

🔹 IPC operation counters and statistics

🔹 Event history tracking

🔹 Deadlock simulation module

🔹 Menu-driven debugger interface

🔹 Graceful termination (no forced Ctrl+C)

📂 Repository Structure IPC-Debugger/ │ ├── ipc_debugger.c # Complete 500+ line source code ├── ipc_log.txt # Generated log file after execution └── README.md # Project documentation

▶️ How to Compile and Run 1️⃣ Prerequisites

MinGW installed and added to system PATH

VS Code or any C-compatible editor

2️⃣ Compile the Code gcc ipc_debugger.c -o ipc_debugger

3️⃣ Run the Program .\ipc_debugger

4️⃣ Exit the Program

Use menu option:

Exit
📊 Sample Output ===== ADVANCED IPC DEBUGGER =====

Message Queue IPC
Shared Memory IPC
Show Dashboard
[PIPE] Sender wrote data [PIPE] Receiver read: Hello via Pipe IPC

🗂️ Logging and Debugging

All IPC activities are logged with timestamps in:

ipc_log.txt

Sample Log Output [14:42:10] [PIPE] Pipe sender wrote data [14:42:11] [MESSAGE_QUEUE] Message enqueued [14:42:12] [SHARED_MEMORY] Shared memory written

This log file helps in tracing IPC events and debugging communication behavior.
